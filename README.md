# Lux (Currently in development)
An app for interfacing with telemetry data from a homemade rover.

# Installation

To run the app in its development state you will have to run <code>npm i</code> or <code>npm install</code>. After that is done installing, run <code>npm start</code> to start the development server. As of writing this (03/30/2023) there is no backend to connect to, so there is not a backend server to start in order to make requests from. 

# Usage

While the app is currently not functional and is still in development here are some planned features:
* be able to create graphs of any combination of telemetry data from an SQL database
* be able to import/export xml files
* save temporary views of graphing queries as 'tabs'
* have a public facing version and a private version which has access to more information
